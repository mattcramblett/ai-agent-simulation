Lab 4 Readme
Matt Cramblett & Matias Grotewold

This scene contains a predator/prey situation where the user is the prey and is attempting to escape from the predators. The predators roam randomly until one of them sees the prey using a vision test. If the prey is at a distance, then only that predator agent becomes alerted and begins moving towards the prey. Once/if it is within a certain distance, it alerts all other predators and they all go into attack mode, moving towards the prey at increased speed. Once the prey is caught, the game is over.

In terms of user input, the user can change their own agent's performance or modify the predator performance or the number of predators. The input is as follows:
S: increases user/prey speed
A: decreases user/prey speed

X: increases predator attack speed
Z: decreases predator attack speed

M: generates a new predator
D: deletes a predator
